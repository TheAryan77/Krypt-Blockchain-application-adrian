# Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application
![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)
## Introduction


Using Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask you'll learn how to build a your first real Web 3.0 Application - from start to finish.
🚀 Just shipped Krypt – A Web3 Ethereum Transaction Portal 🌐✨

Built a full-stack dApp where users can:
🔗 Connect MetaMask & send Ethereum transactions
💬 Attach on-chain messages + GIF context
📡 View a live feed of transactions (sender, receiver, amount, timestamp, message, GIF)
📱 Enjoy a fully responsive UI for both desktop & mobile

Tech Stack:
⚡ Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
🔑 Web3: Ethers.js + MetaMask
📜 Smart Contract: Solidity (Hardhat)
🌀 Patterns: Context API for global state + custom GIF fetch hook

Smart Contract Highlights:

Stores transaction history efficiently

Emits events for realtime-style UI updates

Gas-optimized struct design

What I focused on:
✅ Clean & modular React component architecture
✅ Utility helpers (address shortening, mock data fallback)
✅ Clear separation of blockchain logic & UI state
✅ Smooth, responsive design polish

💡 Future Ideas:
🔹 ENS resolution
🔹 Transaction status polling & event listeners
🔹 Multi-network support
🔹 Light/dark themes + animations
🔹 Back-end indexing (The Graph)

Excited to keep building & exploring NFT integration, Layer 2 scaling, and gas optimizations in the next iterations.
